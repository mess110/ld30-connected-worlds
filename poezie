Level 0
=====

meet the little sphere
the one with no fear
a little rough around the edges
the one which constantly pledges

to break the barrier
to be the one carrier
from worlds long forgotten
bringing egyptian cotton

on the cotton inscribed
in plain english described
no time for a bite
exit stage right

Level 1
==========

the left door was tempting
i hope you're not venting
you'll just get a scare
how did you dare?

don't worry my buddy
the is sun still shiney
it was the smallest mistake
again, again I dictate

go back, go right
never mention this fight
you'll get a red light
go back, go right

Level 2
=======

a.. the little cubes
they went down the tubes
they chose to go left
what a theft

a warning resides
please fallow these guides
a good sphere abides
with reason it prides

it might be wise
keep your eyes
on the prize
go back if you want to rise


Level 3
========

the sphere persisted
it must have insisted
it has a plan
TO BE HIT BY A VAN

Level 4
=======

for choosing my right
here's a white light
a present, i offer
its so we prosper

now leap if you dare
do it with flair
in the abyss
make sure not to miss

Level 5
=======

it's exercise time
I can't find a rhyme
just jump 3 times
stay close to the signs

Level 6
=======

a mistake non the less
you should go back I confess
it might be to late
to save your fate

you'r a gonner unless
our time we compress
try to do less
nevertheless
i will obsess
and try to impress
not in excess
your progress
oh what a mess..

RESTART






in prison, oh dear
but have no fear

a little rough around the edges
this little sphere thinks
unlike all the others, it is in control

ah.. two doors..
our little sphere took the door on the left
