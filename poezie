Intro
=====

meet the little sphere
the one with no fear
a little rough around the edges
the one which constantly pledges

to break the barrier
to be the one carrier
from worlds long forgotten
bringing egyptian cotton

on the cotton inscribed
in plain english described
no time for a bite
exit stage right


Level 1
==========

although otherwise advised
we constantly symphatised
it almost compromised
yes, we are surprised

a mistake regardless
we won't be heartless
go back while you can
you'll be hit by van

Not back
========

the sphere persisted
it must have insisted
it has a plan
TO BE HIT BY A VAN

Still not back
==============

Are you sure?



a mistake non the less
you should go back I confess
dare you step forward







in prison, oh dear
but have no fear

a little rough around the edges
this little sphere thinks
unlike all the others, it is in control

ah.. two doors..
our little sphere took the door on the left
